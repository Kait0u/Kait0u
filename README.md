ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kait0u! Or as they call me in the real world - Jakub Jaworski. 
I am just your friendly neighborhood Programmer. I take interest in Coding, Data Science and Machine Learning.

This place is going to serve as my portfolio for bigger and smaller projects!
I always try to learn new things, so if you have something to say about anything that I will post here, feel free to speak your mind! I will more than appreciate it!

In the future I hope to code for video games, but as of now - my road towards that goal is still pretty long. My determination, however, is unfaltering!

It is a pleasure to be here, and to meet you all.
